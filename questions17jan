1. Program to recognize nested IF control statements and display the levels of nesting.
2. Program to recognize a valid variable, which starts with a letter,followed by any number of letters or digits.
3. Set YYSTYPE to char and do Infix to postfix conversion where lexemes are either operators or single characters instead of numbers.

Sample input: a+b*c

Sample output: abc*+

Hint: This is similar to infix to postfix conversion in stage 2. Here we need to output the lexemes of a token instead of just the token names. Here each lexeme is a single character. Use yylval to pass the lexemes as the attribute values for each token.

4. Set YYSTYPE to char* and do symbolic infix to postfix conversion:

Sample input: hello+my*world

Sample output: hello my world * +

5. Set YYSTYPE to char* and do symbolic infix to prefix conversion:

Sample input: hello+my*world

Sample output: * + hello my world

6.Infix to postfix conversion.
7.Read and write pairs.
8.Simple Calculator.

9.Modify the infix_to_postfix.y such that it gives the value of the complete expression as output. (Hint : use $$ to assign value to head of a rule).
10.Now write a program to concatenate two strings using the operator '+'.
